# EnhancedProgression

Enhanced Progression is a magic/tech mod that adds new rituals and gameplay to survival minecraft. It is currently still in Alpha development and not ready for a survival play through of the game, but the core concepts of the mod are mostly in place now and it is ready for some limited creative mode testing.

## Getting Started

The first thing you want to do in the mod is craft a basic wand. You can craft it with either a tin or copper ingot, so simply replace the ingot in the recipe to create the tin version.

 Once you have a basic wand, you will also need an Altar in order to get started with the mod. This crafting recipe is very temporary and will be changed in the beta releases of the mod.

You are now ready to construct a simple altar in order to start performing rituals and upgrading your wand.

## Tier 1 Altar

Now that you have an Altar, you can place it in the world to construct the most simple type altar, which can only perform the most basic magic. Shift+Rightclick the altar with your want to see the level of altar you have constructed.

At the moment, there are no actual rituals implemented into the altar, but you can throw items on top of it and hover over it to see what it is holding. Throwing certain combinations of items will allow you to perform spells when you rightclick the altar in a future beta update. If you break the altar while it contains items, the items will drop, allowing you to get them back. The altar can store up to 16 items at a time.

Now that you know the basics of using your altar, you can begin to upgrade to higher tier altars in order to perform more rituals and create more spells.

## Tier 2 Altar

When you shift+rightclicked your basic altar with a wand, you saw that it was only a Tier 1 altar. However, with only a small amount of chiseled quartz blocks and hardened clay, you can easily construct the next tier altar, which is the final tier implemented at the moment. The Tier 2 altar requires building a small platform below the altar exactly like it is shown in the picture below. This design isn't final and will be changed later in the development of the mod.

Like with the Tier 1 altar, if you hold your wand and shift+rightclick the altar, you can check what tier it is.

When rituals are properly implemented, the Tier 2 altar will be able to perform more complex rituals than the basic Tier 1 version, and it will be able to infuse more spells into a wand
